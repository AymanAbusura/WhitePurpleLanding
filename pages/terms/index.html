			<b>Important Risk Note:</b><br>
			It should be noted that cryptocurrency trading can be a highly risky investment and should be approached
			with
			caution,
			especially during times of extreme volatility. Data suggests that roughly 70% of investors will lose money
			at
			some point
			in time. However, the market can also be quite lucrative with the right trades.
			</p>
			<p>
			Keep in mind that PrimeAurora, in addition to any other commercial names used on this platform, are for
			commercial
			purposes only. Make sure to read the Terms and Conditions thoroughly, as that will provide everything you
			need
			to know
			about how we operate.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to that, a policy has been issued by the FCA that prohibits the dissemination of marketing
			materials
			related
			to the distribution of CFDs and other financial products on cryptocurrencies. However, this is only
			addressed to
			residents in the UK.

			third
